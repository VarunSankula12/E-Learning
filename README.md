The E-Learning web application is an innovative educational platform designed to provide online learning opportunities for students. This web application is structured into three distinct modules: Admin, Instructor, and Student, each with specific roles and responsibilities. It harnesses a combination of technologies, including Java (JDBC), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap, and is hosted on an Apache Tomcat server.

Admin Module:

The Admin module serves as the backbone of the E-Learning web application, responsible for overseeing and managing all activities. Administrators possess the authority to grant permissions and maintain a secure and controlled environment. They play a crucial role in regulating access and monitoring user behavior within the application.

Instructor Module:

Instructors are pivotal in contributing educational content to the platform. They have the responsibility of uploading courses and quizzes related to their expertise. Instructors are equipped with tools and capabilities to create engaging and informative learning resources, making these materials accessible to students.

Student Module:

The Student module empowers learners to access the extensive educational content provided by instructors. After registration and login, students can explore the available courses. Informed choices can be made based on feedback from fellow students, and courses matching their interests can be purchased. Students can then immerse themselves in the course material, provide feedback, and assess their comprehension by attempting quizzes provided by instructors.

Technologies Used:

The E-Learning web application employs a range of technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive learning experience. These technologies encompass Java with JDBC for backend functionality, HTML and CSS for web page design and layout, JavaScript for interactivity, MySQL for database management, and Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly web design.

Server:

The E-Learning web application is hosted on an Apache Tomcat server, ensuring reliable and efficient access for users. In conclusion, the E-Learning web application offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for online education. It empowers administrators, instructors, and students to participate in a dynamic learning ecosystem, providing a flexible and accessible approach to education in an increasingly digital world.
